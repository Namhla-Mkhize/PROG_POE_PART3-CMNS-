Lecturer Claim Management System
Overview
The Lecturer Claim Management System is an automated application designed to streamline the process of submitting, approving, and tracking lecturer claims. The system is aimed at HR departments, managers, and lecturers, ensuring a faster, more accurate, and transparent claim process.
