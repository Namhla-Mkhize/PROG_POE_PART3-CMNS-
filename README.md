Lecturer Claim Management System
Overview
The Lecturer Claim Management System is an automated application designed to streamline the process of submitting, approving, and tracking lecturer claims. The system is aimed at HR departments, managers, and lecturers, ensuring a faster, more accurate, and transparent claim process.

Purpose
The main goal of this system is to reduce the inefficiencies and errors involved in manual claim management processes. By automating claim submission, approval, and tracking, the system provides a more efficient workflow for lecturers, managers, and HR departments.

Features
Lecturer Claim Submission: Lecturers can easily submit claims with the necessary details, such as claim type, amount, and supporting documentation.
Manager Approval System: Claims are routed to managers for review, where they can approve or reject claims directly within the system.
Automated Report Generation: The system automatically generates reports for approved claims, which can be accessed by HR for auditing and payment processing.
Role-Based Access Control: User roles (Lecturer, Manager, HR) are defined to ensure proper access to relevant parts of the system based on the userâ€™s function.
